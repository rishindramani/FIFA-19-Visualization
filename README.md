# FIFA 19: Data Analysis and Visualization
  
FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of
Electronic Arts' FIFA series. It is the 26th installment in the FIFA series. FIFA is not only
a game or tournament for football fans, but it is emotion that drives them through the game.
FIFA lovers are found around the globe. FIFA is a tournament in which many clubs
compete to win a trophy. Some of the popular teams that participate in FIFA are Real
Madrid, FC Barcelona, PGS, Juventus etc. Different players from different countries come
together in a club and plays together. They compete with the other club. Some of the most
popular players are Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr, Luka Modric etc.
FIFA 19â€™s dataset gives detailed description of all the players that are participating in FIFA
19 tournament. FIFA 19 dataset allows one to know the player and their statistics. The
dataset contains information of all 18207 players from the latest edition FIFA 19. There
are 89 attributes including personal information like age, name, nationality, photo, club,
wage, etc., and player skill information like ball control, dribbling, crossing, finishing, GK
skills, etc. As a football fan, and as a video game lover, I have played and watched a lot
of football. From my experience of the game I have come up with following objectives as
exploration on the provided FIFA 19 complete player dataset.
